# The Dicee Game.
This program randomly selects a number between 1 to 6 for two different dicee, one for player 1 and the other for player 2. Whoever gets the biggest number wins, and if both dice end up with the same number it's a draw. To play it again, simply refresh the page.

This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make it.
