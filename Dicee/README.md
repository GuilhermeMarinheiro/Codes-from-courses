The Dicee Game.
This program simply opens up and randomly selects a number between 1 to 6 for two different dicee, one for player 1 and the other for player 2. Whoever gets the biggest number wins, and if both dice end up with the same number it's a draw. To play it again, simply refresh the page.
This project takes basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript usage to make it, but it is a pretty good way to test your knowledge once you're starting to program in those languages. Up in this folder you shall find the files for HTML, CSS, and Javascript so you can see how I made it.
