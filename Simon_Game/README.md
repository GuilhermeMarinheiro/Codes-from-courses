# Simon Says.
This program emulates the game Simon Says. It consists of four buttons, all with different colors, that randomly light up with a distinct sound effect. The game begins by having a random button light up, then you need to press it, then another one lights up, and you need to press the previous button, then the one the game choosen previously. This goes on until you miss click it. Much like the original, it's basically a memory game where you can train your memory and play with your friends.

I had some troubles when first making this one, due to the nature of requiring more comands from the program as well as the ability to remember what buttons you pressed, and which buttons the game asked for, but as you can see I eventually figured it out after taking another look at the course classes. It still runs only on HTML, CSS, and Javascript without the adds of things like Node and Express, and the files will be in the folder for you to see them.
