The Drum Keyboard.
This program turn specific keys of your keyboard into pieces of a basic drum set once you press them, as well as adding a little animation for when you press said keys. There is no winner or loser like in the other projects, but I personally find it amusing to try and replicate drum solos on this keyboard.
It took a bit more effort than the Dicee game to make this project, adding animations to it, the ability to respond to certain keyboard inputs in a certain way as well as making the actual sound come from specific keys. Up in this folder you shall find the files for HTML, CSS, and Javascript so you can see how I made it.
